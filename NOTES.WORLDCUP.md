```
Hour: local time when the match was scheduled to start (ie. for delayed matches see additional notes). European countries use generally GMT+1, with the exception of England and Spain (GMT). South American countries use GMT-5 or GMT-6, Mexico uses GMT-8 and USA uses GMT-5 to GMT-8 depending on place. Add/substract as needed to obtain the hour at which the match started in your country. You need to take DST into account as well, which makes converting older (pre-1960) times doubtful.

City, Stadium name: in local language if possible. However for Switzerland the versions generally accepted in English have been adopted.

Result: teams, result, half-result with additional data on extra-time 
(ie. the first result in parentheses is the one after 45 min, 
the second after 90 min, 
the third after 105 min). 
This could be simplified with the introduction of the golden goal rule. Also the result of penalty shootout if one occured (the British practice is to sum up goals from game and shootout when giving result, which is NOT encouraged).


Attendance: in many cases approximate. Various sources make different guesses, and reliable data just isn't available sometimes. Attendance has more than often been calculated on the basis of tickets sold, not by counting spectators.

The + sign before the number means "more than", - means "less than" and ~ means "around, approximately, more or less".

Referees: the first one is the main referee, the two following are linesmen. I have not included the technical referees who appeared at France '98, despite FIFA treating them as part of the traditional trio when presenting WC 98 stats on www.fifa.com.

Line ups: Captains are marked with (c). It was assumed that pre-war teams played 1-2-3-5, in the 50s this was changed to 1-3-2-5 (WM system), later to 1-2-4-4 (Brasil in 1962), 1-3-3-4, 1-4-3-3 and finally 1-4-4-2. Of course where there was evidence that a team used a different style that the one widely adopted at the time, this has been taken into account.

Goals: some sources may report the scorers differently, especially with respect to own goals. Minutes are +/- 1 due to the way some sources count them (ie. whether the first minute starts at kick-off or after 60 secs). 

The letters after minutes mean: 
- p - penalty kick goal, 
- f - free kick goal, 
- h - header goal, 
- o - own goal, 
- c - corner goal. 
Penalties which were missed are also noted. "Out" in this context means also a crossbar or goalpost.


Bookings: list of names from both teams, separated by a / (slash). The list is ordered randomly and does not reflect actual booking order.

Additional notes: info on extraordinary occurances like a serious match delay, match called off (SWE-AUT in 1938), jubilee (centenary) matches and some other trivia. Also the method of calculating table positions was explained whenever it differed from the one now accepted at WC.
